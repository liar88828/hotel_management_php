- **Profile Management**: Users can update their profile information.
- **Online Payments**: Integration with **Paytm** for online payments (or any payment gateway of your choice).

### Admin End:
- **Room Management**: Admins can add, modify, or delete rooms and their details.

## Setup and Installation

### Requirements:
- PHP 7.x or later
- MySQL Database
- A web server (Apache, Nginx, etc.)
- Composer (Optional for managing dependencies)

### Steps to Run:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hotel-booking-website.git
   ```

2. **Database Setup**:
   - Create a MySQL database and import the `hotel_booking.sql` file located in the `database/` directory.
   - Update the database configuration in `inc/db_config.php` file with your database credentials:
     ```php
     define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
     define('DB_USER', 'your_db_username');
     define('DB_PASS', 'your_db_password');
     define('DB_NAME', 'your_db_name');
     ```

3. **Admin Account Setup**:
   - Manually insert admin credentials into the `admin_cred` table in the database. Example:
     ```sql
     INSERT INTO admin_cred (admin_name, admin_pass) VALUES ('admin', 'password');
     ```

4. **Run the Project**:
   - Place the project files in your web server's root directory (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP, `www` for WAMP).
   - Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost/hotel-booking-website/` to view the user side.
   - Navigate to `http://localhost/hotel-booking-website/admin/` for the admin panel.
